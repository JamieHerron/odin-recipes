    <h3>Handmade Italian-style Pizza</h3>

    <p>From the rustic hills of Italy, this traditional Italian-style
        pizza will have your friends and family coming back for more.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
    </ol>
