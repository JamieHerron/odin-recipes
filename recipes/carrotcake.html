    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Raisins</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Icing sugar</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins.</li>
    </ol>
